## About Me
Hi, I'm **Houyou Lei** from Chengdu, China, and I recently graduated from **Shanxi University** with dual degrees in **Applied Chemistry** and **Biology**.

During my undergraduate studies, I spent most of my research time in an organic synthesis lab, where I gained extensive knowledge about organic solar cells. I explored their underlying principles, design, and applications, as well as their crucial role in advancing renewable energy solutions.   

Although I started learning computational chemistry quite late, I firmly believe that life is a never-ending learning process, not a sprint to the finish. In the few months I’ve dedicated to it, I’ve acquired valuable insights into molecular behavior and developed a better understanding of how simulations and data analysis help study complex chemical systems. Still, I am not satisfied with merely using software packages, and I often question whether my computational methods are truly accurate. And this has motivated me to explore the physics, mathematics, and computer science behind these methods.   
Moreover, I have had a strong passion for physics and mathematics, especially algebra, even before I began exploring computational chemistry. Although I am still refining my math skills, I truly enjoy engaging with the subject. A book that particularly sparked my interest in algebra is *Linear Algebra Done Right* (it's really an good resource!).   

In addition, I believe that, when it comes to macroscopic issues, probability depends on given conditions and cannot be directly applied to physical objects. This perspective has fueled my interest in statistics and machine learning. I am confident that machine learning and scientific computing will transform traditional, labor-intensive methods of chemical discovery.   

*I am actively seeking a Ph.D. program, aiming for admission in Fall 2025*
