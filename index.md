## About Me
Hi, I'm **Houyou Lei** from Chengdu, China, and I recently graduated from **Shanxi University** with dual degrees in **Applied Chemistry** and **Biology**.

During my undergraduate studies, I spent most of my research time in an organic synthesis lab, where I gained extensive knowledge about organic solar cells. I explored their underlying principles, design, and applications, as well as their crucial role in advancing renewable energy solutions.

I actually started learning computational chemistry quite late, but the few months I dedicated to it provided me with valuable insights into molecular behavior and enhanced my understanding of the potential of simulations and data analysis in understanding complex chemical systems.

Moreover, I have a strong passion for physics and mathematicsâ€”especially algebra. Although I am still refining my math skills, I truly enjoy engaging with the subject. A book that particularly sparked my interest in algebra is *Linear Algebra Done Right*; it's an good resource.  
I believe that, when it comes to macroscopic issues, probability depends on given conditions and cannot be directly applied to physical objects. This perspective has fueled my interest in statistics and machine learning. I am confident that machine learning and scientific computing will transform traditional, labor-intensive methods of chemical discovery.

*I am actively seeking a Ph.D. program, aiming for admission in Fall 2025*   
*Thank you for your visiting!*
